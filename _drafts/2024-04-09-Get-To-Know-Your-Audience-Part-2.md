How should address your audience?

I talked about in [this post](2024/04/02/So-you-want-to-get-to-know-your-audience.html) about beginning by centering yourself and focusing in on your aim.

I want to kind of expand this idea to incorporate more things about the medium your message is coming in.

The first question is tone:
- Is this meant to be entertaing like a science YouTube or a TEDTalk - you want to be <b>punchy, funny, and suprising</b>
- Maybe this is <b>a box-ticking exercise</b> for a regulatory purpose.  This will encourage you to be _Just The Facts, Ma'am_ and to the point.  
- Maybe they're likely to <b>disbelieve you</b> that you can do this (I'm looking at you, <b>dissertation committees</b>).  This will encourage you to be _thorough_ and to provide a tone that is _serious_.  
- Are you hoping for your audience to <b>take action</b> from your presentation?  Buy your product, fund you for future work, make a decision, take action. You want to express _urgency_, have a _concrete call to action_, and have an audience that consists of <b>actual decision makers.</b>

These all fall out of the aims you clarified before you started.
