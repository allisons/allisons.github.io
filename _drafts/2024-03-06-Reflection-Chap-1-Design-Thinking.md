> "Although we tend to admire designers for their solutions, it is often their ability to find the right _problems_ which distinguishes good from adequate design or poor design"

Bryan Lawson, [_Design in Mind_](https://search.worldcat.org/title/30079515)

> ...it arose more rather more prosaically by applying an analogy (the form of a squid) to the problem that was on Philippe's mind (a novel form for a lemon squeezer.) This kind of analogy-making is ofte proposed as a means of encouraging creative thinking.

Peter Lloyd and Dirk Snelders [_What was Philippe Starck thinking Of?_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X02000546)

> Schon established his theory of reflective practice as a counter to a more prevalent theory of technical rationality or the constrained application of scientific theory and technique to practical problems"

> 'competent practitioners usually know more than they can say.  They exhibita  kind of knowing-in-practice, most of which is tacit"

> "As Quist reflects on the unexpected consequences and implications of his moves, he listens to the situations back-talk, forming new appreciations which guide his further moves"

> "...a problem frame can prove to be inappropriate...and so a new departure point, a new problem frame becomes necessary"

Donald Schon, [_The Reflective Practitioner_](https://search.worldcat.org/title/976441596)

>"Logic has interests in abstract forms.  Science investigates extant forms.  Design initiates novel forms"

Lionel March: The Logic of Design in _The Architecture of Form_ (too hard to find)

> The range of design techniques, such as sketching prototyping, mock-ups, scenarios, enables the designer ot make 'an inquiry into the future situation of use"

Henrik Gedenryd, [_How Designers Work_](https://search.worldcat.org/title/40940265)

The big takeaways for me in this chapter was this idea of the problem, proposed solution, updated understanding of the problem, new proposed solution cycle and the importance of getting that outside your own head - for architects it looks a lot like sketching but I don't know that that's appropriate for data.  Or if it is, what that looks like.

I also want to spend some time with abductive reasoning - bbedit doesn't even think it's a word so that sound like rich ground for some new thinking.

I didn't realize until I was writing up quotations that I referred so much to the Reflective Practiioner.  I'll probably want to request that ILL too.
