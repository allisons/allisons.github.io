Desire paths are unplanned trails and an emergent property of many people making the same (predictable, understandable) choice to ignore the official path and taking a shorter one.  It's frequently a diagonal across a corner, or a path through a field when the landscaper would have walkers circumnavigate. 

What's the purpose of a path?  To direct traffic through an area, to get people from one place to another.  It might also be to protect the delicate environment it goes through, to make a display of what you see as you go through, be easy to maintain, etc.

An desire path fails on a number of levels - if you're not on the path, the path isn't doing its job.  It doesn't protect the environment and it's not easy to maintain.

So why did it fail?  Humans don't want to take extra steps going from one place to another - if they're not physically barred, they're probably going to take the diagonal. I don't want to and you can't make me.

You might look at this situation and think "What transgressive users!" but a designer will look at this and say "This design is a failure".  The designers failed to appropriately empathize with their users.

So, what are the desire paths for data presentation?

A data products' purpose is to collect inputs from relevant sources, transform those into an analysis that is informative and display it in a way that a data user can contextualize it and have it influence their actions.  The elephant-path style failures occur in that step when we hand the data display over to the user.  If they don't understand what it's displaying, it doesn't answer the question they have, or it's not in a position to influence their actions, we get desire paths of data.  They look at that beautifully designed and built staircase and say "No, thank you"

You might have a product that's one-and-done.  "This is a snapshot of the state of the union" - I think of this as bespoke data.  It can hyperspecialized to this particular context, making some of the other design choices easier.  Consultancies provide a lot of this service.  Their expertise comes from having done similar things for similar companies and they can do it fast.  They're craftsmen.

More common are dashboards.

An analytics dashboard is probably what you think of when you think of a data product.  It's a dynamic, self-updating layout of data display.  It's only useful if you need to know the answers to a small number of questions over and over again - the data has to be re-queried on a regular basis.

The ideal dashboard hew closest to the dashboard dashboards were named after - the one behind your steering wheel.  It's only a few widgets - speedometer, odometer, gas or charge level, maybe a tachometer.  These are things you need to know and things you need to know right now and things that are constantly changing.  Its simplicity and relevance are undeniable.

So how might a dashboard show an desire-path style failure?

- it's looked at once and never again.
- the customer is constantly requesting changes and no steady state is reached
- only some small part of the dashboard is used
- only one small section of the drill down is used.
- the dashboard isn't trusted and so it has no effect on decision making.

A data failure is one that doesn't bend your users' pathway - with or without you they always going to go to the shortest path.  Data doesn't count if data has no impact.
