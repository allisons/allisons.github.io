All content on this page is the not-entirely-well-thought-out ideas of Allison Sliter.  Allison lives in SE Portland, OR with her daughters and her husband and thinks the weather there is always perfect.  She is interested in science communication, design, world history, genre fiction, the community of data scientists, urbanism, fashion, Japanese stationary, cycling, interpretive signs, land use planning, the green economy, equity and social justice, libraries, thrift store shopping, animal-shaped slippers, and education policy. She will start up a conversation with virtually anyone and encourage you to reach out if you want to talk about any of these topics or to suggest a new one.
