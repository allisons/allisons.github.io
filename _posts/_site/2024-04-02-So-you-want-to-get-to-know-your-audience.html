<p>Every introduction to public speaking includes the admonititon to know your audience.  I’ve had it on my own slides for years.  But in my experience, it’s nice work if you can get it. Most of the time the actual composition of your audience is fuzzy at best and often a complete mystery so what is a desolate public speaker to do?</p>

<p>You can begin by centering yourself. What is <em>your</em> aim?  Why are you doing this talk?</p>

<p>Here’s an example I just did for a talk this morning.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Q: Why are you presenting today?</p>

<p>A: My collegeaue asked me to.</p>

<p>Q: Why did she ask you to?</p>

<p>A: People in the department were curious.&lt;/right&gt;</p>

<p>Q: Why were people curious?</p>

<p>A: We’ve talked about trying to do this thing for years but the techincal challenges seemed insurmountable.&lt;/</p>

<p>Q: But they aren’t anymore?</p>

<p>A: No.</p>

<p>Q: What changed?</p>

<p><em>Answer covered by an NDA</em></p>

<p>Q: Okay, so <em>why</em> are you presenting this?</p>

<p>Final Answer: I’m presenting to my colleagues to tell them about the innovations that have led to a breakthrough for a long term goal.</p>

<p>Once you know why you’re in the room, you can start to invite your audience into the room with you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is this meant to be entertaing like a science YouTube or a TEDTalk - you want to be <b>punchy, funny, and suprising</b>.</li>
  <li>Maybe this is <b>a box-ticking exercise</b> for a regulatory purpose.  This will encourage you to be <em>Just The Facts, Ma’am</em> and to the point.</li>
  <li>Maybe they’re likely to <b>disbelieve you</b> that you can do this (I’m looking at you, <b>dissertation committees</b>).  This will encourage you to be <em>thorough</em> and to provide a tone that is <em>serious</em>.</li>
  <li>Are you hoping for your audience to <b>take action</b> from your presentation?  Buy your product, fund you for future work, make a decision, take action. You want to express <em>urgency</em>, have a <em>concrete call to action</em>, and have an audience that consists of <b>actual decision makers.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s crucial that you be clear eyed about your aim.  Are you doing this for clout?  Are you doing this because invited talks advantage your CV? Are you doing this because your boss asked you to?</p>

<p>Starting by knowing what you are about has a couple of advantages - I think the most important one being that it’s within reach.  An audience can be an effable, theoretical thing.  Focusing on your goals first, making them crystal clear and concrete will naturally shape how you interact with your audience.</p>
