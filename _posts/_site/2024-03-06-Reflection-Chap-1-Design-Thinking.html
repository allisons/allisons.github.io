<blockquote>
  <p>“Although we tend to admire designers for their solutions, it is often their ability to find the right <em>problems</em> which distinguishes good from adequate design or poor design”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…it arose more rather more prosaically by applying an analogy (the form of a squid) to the problem that was on Philippe’s mind (a novel form for a lemon squeezer.) This kind of analogy-making is ofte proposed as a means of encouraging creative thinking.</p>

  <p>Schon established his theory of reflective practice as a counter to a more prevalent theory of technical rationality or the constrained application of scientific theory and technique to practical problems”</p>

<p>The big takeaways for me in this chapter was this idea of the problem, proposed solution, updated understanding of the problem, new proposed solution cycle and the importance of getting that outside your own head - for architects it looks a lot like sketching but I don’t know that that’s appropriate for data.  Or if it is, what that looks like.</p>

<p>I also want to spend some time with abductive reasoning - bbedit doesn’t even think it’s a word so that sound like rich ground for some new thinking.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize until I was writing up quotations that I referred so much to the Reflective Practiioner.  I’ll probably want to request that ILL too.</p>
