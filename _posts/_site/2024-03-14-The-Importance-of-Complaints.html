<p>I am by my nature a complainer.  I try to be pleasant, I try to be cheerful.  No one wants to be the Negative Nelly.</p>

<p>But it’s in my nature.  Like the Terminator, I am constantly scanning my environment and evaluating and judging.  I notice plenty of wonderful things but you can’t look at this world as it is and not find it coming up lacking.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m the only one like this - this hyper-vigilance against imperfection is the hallmark of the stand up comic, the quality assurance engineer, and the concrete layer.  <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Never fear, however.  Encouragement of (pointed, specific) complaint is, I will argue, the heart and soul of good design.  “Good enough” doesn’t motivate change.  Generic dissatisfaction never shows a way forward.  But pointed, snarky, berating complaint…now that’s where the money is.</p>

<p>I want to know your pain points.  I want to know what annoys you.</p>

<p>I don’t need a problem solver.  I need a problem identifier.</p>

      <p>“Wait” says the attentive reader.  “Isn’t this perfectionism?””  It is not.  I am much less interested in my own shortcomings than those outside of me. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
