With intent and audience chosen, content comes easily.  Your audience has expectations, a background, an interest, and a set of time constraits. Your intent will concretely determine what you want your audience to think or know after you've completed your presentation. What to leave in and what to leave out.

Across all kinds of talks, a fact you cannot avoid is that time is bound and there is a finite amount your audience's brains can handle.  When I see talks go wrong many, many times it comes from overestimating the amount their audience can absorb.  For this reason, it's crucial to understand who you are talking to so you can balance breadth and depth appropriately.  That ratio will also depend on what you're hoping to accomplish with the talk.  You may be willing to sacrifice breadth to reach a specialized audience when you hope to impart new knowledge or skills.  

Structure is the most underrated part of any impactful talk.  The right content, to the right audience with the wrong structure can torpedo your talk.  Ironically, it's overlooked or boilerplated in 90% of the talks I've seen.  When you've seen talks you've come away with thinking as "good" it's almost certainly due to the structure they presented the information in.

It's still very hard to talk about without concrete examples so we're going to lean heavily on our cannonical talk types. 

##### Internal Report

![Inverted Pyramid](images/inverted_pyramid.jpg)

For internal reports, I utilize the (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism))[Inverted Pyramid] structure.  This molds both the structure and content for my talks.  In short, I share a key finding, explain why the key finding is relevant, and show the data that supports the keyfinding.  And then I stop talking. 

When I see other internal reports, the structure I often see is "This is the question we were trying to answer.  This is how we tried to answer it. That didn't work.  So we tried to answer it this way.  That worked.  Here's the answer.  Any questions?"  I call this the hero's journey structure of a talk.  It's common because it's the way _the presenter_ experienced the work they did.  They've been asked to report on the work they did and they do. But from the moment you start talking, you're beginning to fill your audience's finite capacity for attention and your intent fulfillment comes at the very end.  Your audience may not get there with you.  This is why I say the wrong structure can torpedo your talk.

I want to underline: this structure never stops feeling awkward to me in the writing stage.  The temptation to preface myself haunts me always.  For this reason, I frequently allow myself to begin my slide deck in that more narrative[^1] way and then just promote the answer slide to the top.  But the feedback I get on my talks expresses over and over again that no matter how awkward it may feel to me, it works for my audience, most of whom are smart but not expert in the field I'm presenting on.

##### A conference paper presentation

The core content of a paper presentation will obviously be tied to the paper it's based on.  There will be some kind of thesis or conclusion.  From there, the level of context, background, details will depend on your specific intent. You often can count on a little more overall volume in the amount of content you can provide and you'll get some degree of "permission" to go deep with a well-constructed abstract.  

##### Internal Product Demo

The intent of a product demo is to keep the company apprised of how things are going on a particular project.  I've described the structure and content as being like an episode of a primetime drama.  You start with "Previously on" which gives a very select number of references to previous episodes that will have bearing on tonight's drama.  The episode itself pushes the narrative along and gets us to the next step and is concluded with "next time on".  The salient points here is that the previously on and next time on exist but are a very small part of the show.


[^1]: "But isn't (design|data|product|sales) all about storytelling?"  No.  I will be taking no questions at this time.  ...okay, fine.  Storytelling is a form of entertainment, perhaps the most ancient form of entertainment.  Its purpose (its intent in my parlance) is to bring an audience in and take them away for a period of time. It has characters and action and a beginning, middle and end. A story leaves an audienced changed, but not in the sense of being informed.  It's also incredibly hard to do well. One of the themes I want to touch on with this series is that when you do something that you think makes your talk easier, it's probably you doing another thing that's actually very hard and you're doing poorly. If the metaphor of storytelling helps you fulfill your intent, I'm not here to yuck your yum.  But if what I want you to know is that third quarter sales are on target, Little Red Riding Hood can stay home.
