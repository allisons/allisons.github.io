I've begun the process of creating a curriculum for myself for this project.  I've got a reading list (ever growing, sometimes shrinking) that I'm keeping off-site for now but I'm beginning with 

> Cross, N. (2023). <i>Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work.</i> (2nd ed.). Bloomsbury Visual Arts.

I found this book in the Pearl Room at Powells Books more or less randomly (note to self: Powells is not a library, they'll happily sell you a book that isn't what you're asking for).  This is where all the art books are but also the computer science-y tech-manually kinds of books are.  I sought it out thinking I'd be finding something of the place I'm trying to go with this project, namely "Let's do what they did for project management and design thinking but apply it to data science."

But the first sentence of the introduction immediately set me straight:

>"There are two rather different interpretations of 'design thinking'.  Both are based on the practices of designers, but one (the original formulation of 'design thinking') is focused firmly within design practice whereas the other (a more recent but perhaps transient formulation) is focused outside the normal design domain, nortably in business and the management of innovation"

Let me tell you, it's cold here in Nigel's shade.

Nevertheless, let's carry on!

The idea I had in my brain was that there are things that Designers Know How To Do.  And it involves creatively and actively taking an entire entity from non-existence to existence.  And to have that thing be useful to someone else.  Knowing that designers of vastly different products use so many of the same tools, I got it in my head that I could use those same tools or determine analogs for them as I went along.  

What is design thinking?  Well, according to Professor Google it is anywhere between 3 and 6 principles that all seem to start with "empathize" (without really telling you what that means), "ideate" (yes, but how does one come up with new ideas?), and implement (okay go make it!) with extra bits in between for Reasons.  I'll give the whole idea the benefit of the doubt that if I found the book length treatments rather than the medium posts and the sponsored blogs from adobe, I might get details. And those will go on the list of reading material.

But in the meantime, reading the first 3 chapters (and back dating this introduction) has shown that the world of design and how designers think has a great deal to offer in how to actually do the things you're supposed to do in design thinking.  

So I'm looking for tips, I'm looking for practices, I'm looking for things I can project into my experience and expertise.  What does a client brief look like when you're putting together a quantitative evaluation of a novel technology.  How do you know if your data is having a meaningful impact on your audience?  How do you make a more meaningful impact? Can design help with that?

That's what I'm trying to find out.
