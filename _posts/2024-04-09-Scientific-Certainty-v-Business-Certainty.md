My expertise is in taking the squishy, abstract requests from product and sales and the concrete and specific approaches that engineering needs and turning them into plans/approaches/models.

The right level of specificity is extremely important the project I've been working on lately is asking the right questions to get that right level of specificity.

If you want your quantiative analysis to move your audience to action, you have to be speaking their language and that means the aesthetic of the approach matters.

I'm sitting between scientists and people who represent the customer.  The decision makers and the check signers are not engineers or scientists.  Decision makers are executives and account managers. 

For each group, we need to surface the explicit assumptions.  They often surprise each other.

You know what's a really slippery concept?  The simplifying assumption.  So many of the people I work with come from a science background and from your first day in physics 101, you're told to imagine spherical cows in a frictionless plane.  It's hard to understand how foreign that is if you've not been raised on it since you were a baby scientist.

The inate human response is to say "But there's no such thing" - we get beaten into hearing "I know there's no such thing but go with me anyway" because we're undergrads and we have to.  But remember from this post, your customer can always say No Thank You.  And when you bring them spherical cows in a frictionless plane, they will.

Instead, when working with business clients, more important than simplicity is applicability. But in exchange, it's less important that your results are statistically significant.  "Are we going to do better than last year?" is an easier question than "Is there a greater than 95% chance that we will do 9% better than last year?"
