"Know Your Audience" is the cliche.  We're going to replace that with "Choose Your Audience"

After discussing this topic with several colleagues [^1], my thinking evolved about audience.  

>We have a standing meeting where each of the engineering teams are meant to give an update. This isn't a demo, it's just a check-in with other teams to see that everyone is in approximately the same place re: the road map.  It needs to be quick and high level when things are going well and it needs to be in-depth and complicated when we're struggling.

So far so good.  We have an intent - keep all the flock all headed in the same direction.  We have an audience - peers in other project squads.

>But the EVP of Engineering and COO have been coming to these meetings.  Ostensibly as flys-on-the-wall, but that's not the reality of when your boss's boss's boss is in the room and so is her boss.  This has resulted in a flipped script - emphasizing success for the EVP and COO, smoothing over the complicated technical details for a managerial audience.

The engineers presenting _do_ know their audience and that's the problem.  To get the meetings to return to their intent, they need to choose their audience. [^2]

This distinction is between chosen audience and interested bystander and it's your intent that describes that distinction.

Is your intent to sign a contract?  The signing power needs to be in the room.  Is your intent to defend your dissertation?  Your friends and colleagues should 100% be there to support you, but your audience is the committee.  Are you a directed researcher keeping your leadership on board with your funding?  The highly technical explanation may be helpful for your direct IC peers, but you'll be undermining your intent if it can't be understood by your (smart but not expert).

That is not to say you should only speak to the "audience" - some of the performance (more on that later) has to be feinting towards your interested bystanders and there's nothing more awkward than staring at one person.  But speaking to your chosen audience is, in the parlance of Agile, the acceptance criteria.  If you don't reach them, you have not fulfilled your intent.


[^1]: a peek behind the curtain, I don't know what I think about any topic until I hear myself say it out loud.

[^2]: This is admittedly a tall order for ICs who really want to keep their jobs.  My recommendation to the colleague I was speaking to (a director of engineering) was to convince the big bosses their presence was counter productive and get them to stop attending.  You can imagine the look he gave me.
