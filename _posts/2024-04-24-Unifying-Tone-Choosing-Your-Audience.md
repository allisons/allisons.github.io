"Know Your Audience" is the cliche.  We're going to replace that with "Choose Your Audience".[^1]

When you've established your intent, it becomes clear from that who you need to have in the room with you to address that intent and who in the room can't get you there.  

Example:

>We have a standing meeting where each of the engineering teams are meant to give an update. This isn't a demo, it's just a check-in with other teams to see that everyone is in approximately the same place re: the road map.  It needs to be quick and high level when things are going well and it needs to be in-depth and complicated when we're struggling and needing feedback. But the EVP of Engineering and COO have been coming to these meetings.  Ostensibly as flys-on-the-wall, but that's not the reality of when your boss's boss's boss is in the room and so is her boss.  This has resulted in a flipped script - emphasizing success for the EVP and COO, smoothing over the complicated technical details for a managerial audience.

The engineers presenting _do_ know their audience and that's the problem.  To get the meetings to return to their intent, they need to choose their audience.

That is not to say you should only speak to the "audience" - some of the performance (more on that later) has to be feinting towards your interested bystanders and there's nothing more awkward than staring at one person.  But when "flys on the wall" come to town, altering your approach for them will undermine the intent you set out with.

The canonical examples:

- Internal reporting comes in a number of versions. When I'm intending to get feedback on what I have been working on, my audience is my manager and the subject matter experts who can speak directly to it.  When I'm delivering parameters for a model implementation, my audience are the software engineers who are building it.  When I'm hoping to tie a bow around a long-term investigation my audience will be most of my department. 

- For a conference paper, the selected intent will have an influence on how you distinguish between your chosen audience and interested bystanders.  For many intents (collaboration, progress in the field), the main audience will be peer researchers.  This is an audience that should be particularly easy to model for you as you are also the audience for this same type of talk being given by your peers.  If you are hoping to be a spokesman for your field or lab, you may want to try to bring students or researchers with distinct but related specialties along for the ride.  Your primary intent will drive your primary audience that will in turn drive your content and performance.

- For a product demo, your selected audience are your potential users.  This may sound obvious but it will take discernment to have a sense of who your potential users are rather than imaginary users. 


[^1]: I want to say a word about The Abstract.  Conference talks, tech talks, product demos and internal reports all have something like an abstract.  A well-crafted abstract is an agreement with your attendees and will allow them to sort themselves into audience or interested bystanders (or going to go get coffee instead).  An abstract should cover your subject matter, hint at the level of detail you'll be going into, pique interest, and set a tone.  _Do not write your abstract first_.  When you write the abstract when the CFP is due and write the talk when the conference comes up, you're catfishing your audience and no one comes out of that situation smelling good.
