Every introduction to public speaking includes the admonititon to know your audience.  I've had it on my own slides for years.  But in my experience, it's nice work if you can get it. Most of the time the actual composition of your audience is fuzzy at best and often a complete mystery so what is a desolate public speaker to do?  

I have several ideas in terms of concretizing the knowing your audience question, but I want to start here:

<h3>Start with understanding yourself.</h3>

What is _your_ aim?  Why are you doing this talk?

Here's an example I just did for a talk this morning.[^1]

Q: Why are you presenting today?

A: My collegeaue asked me to.

Q: Why did she ask you to?

A: People in the department were curious.

Q: Why were people curious?

A: We've talked about trying to do this thing for years but the techincal challenges seemed insurmountable.

Q: But they aren't anymore?

A: No.

Q: What changed?

_Answer covered by an NDA_

Q: Okay, one more time, _why_ are you presenting this?

Final Answer: I'm presenting to my colleagues to tell them about the innovations that have led to a breakthrough for a long term goal.

Once you know why you're in the room, you can start to invite your audience into the room with you.

Starting by knowing what you are about has a couple of advantages - I think the most important one being that it's within reach.  An audience can be an effable, theoretical thing.  Focusing on your goals first, making them crystal clear and concrete will naturally shape how you interact with your audience.
