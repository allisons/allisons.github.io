This is the first part in a series I'm calling "Unifying Tone".  The introduction to the concept is covered [here](/2024/04/09/Unifying-Tone.html) and I'm hoping to flesh out each step a little more.

Every introduction to public speaking includes the admonititon to know your audience.  I've had it on my own slides for years.  In my experience, however, this is the kind of vague advice that leaves one unsure of how to take the first step.  My series on unifying tone came out of that, with the audience question fitting into the greater schema.

Start with your own intent. This has a couple of advantages but at the very least, you have access to your intent even if you don't have access to the mind of your audience (yet).

You need to answer the question: what am I even doing here?  What reason do I have to open mouth or take these people's time?  

I imagine a conversation with my kid when she was a preschooler.

Q: Why are you presenting today?

A: My collegeaue asked me to.

Q: But why did she ask you to?

A: People in the department were curious.

Q: Why were people curious?

A: We've talked about trying to do this thing for years but the technical challenges seemed insurmountable.

Q: But they aren't anymore?

A: No.

Q: What changed?

Q: Okay, one more time, _why_ are you presenting this?

Final Answer: I'm presenting to my colleagues to inform them about the innovations that have led to a breakthrough for a long term goal.

This was a relatively straight forward one, but wrapped in that answer is a lot of the things we're going to need building on top of this unifying tone layer cake.  The audience is my colleagues - I can assume a lot of background knowledge.  I know their interest because it was the interest that drove the talk.  The talk should be structured in a way that very briefly reminds them of the background and then goes straight into a demo.  They'll want to see pictures of everything.  I know the tone can be casual but it's a technical group so it also has to be thorough and complete.  The casualness means my slides can be just illustrative, they don't need to be particularly brand-unifying or anything. And I'll need to have a performance that invites and encourages interaction and questions.

It really just falls out of that first intent.

Some of the various goals I've had in the past:

- convince a department to stop using the manual process that they understood and trusted but was slow, expensive, and misleading and instead adopt a new SOP that I was presenting.
- convince a customer to stop questioning whether or not our technology would have a measurable effect on their bottom line.
- convince a customer to sign a new contract
- convince the leadership of my department to leave me alone and let me work on a project that had a medium long time horizon to marketability.
- convince my colleagues to stop using the template of a conference paper as the template for their presentations at demo meetings.

These are not diplomatic ways of putting these intents.  That's by design.  This is the client brief. If you can get to the point where you can say straight up or down, success or failure, you're going to find the next steps so much easier and you'll be able to look back and know how much progress you've made in your data science as design journey. You don't have to share this with anyone else - it's about keeping it clear in your mind. But keep yourself honest.  

Good luck.  I believe in you.  Just channel your [inner complainer](/2024/03/14/The-Importance-of-Complaints.html)
