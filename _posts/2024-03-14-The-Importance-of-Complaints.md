I am constantly scanning my environment and evaluating and judging.  I don't even realize I'm doing it.  And it does not make me popular.  "Unfortunately, this doesn't conform to Allison's version of good data science." I notice plenty of wonderful things but you can't look at this world as it is and not find it coming up lacking.  

But I know I'm not the only one like this - this hyper-vigilance against imperfection is the hallmark of the stand up comic, the quality assurance engineer, and the concrete layer. And of course, the designer.  To see through the good enough and get to what's wrong.  Designers know no matter how good something is, it can always be better.

Maybe you're a complainer, too? Maybe you find yourself asking, "But why..." to the impatience of those around you.  It can be lonely but that voice is so precious.  Listen to it. It won't make you popular, either.  But it will make you better at your job.  Tech is filled with problem solvers.  If you can be a problem identifier, you can make real change.
