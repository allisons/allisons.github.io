I am constantly scanning my environment and evaluating and judging.  I don't even realize I'm doing it.  And it does not make me popular.  I come across as a Negative Nelly.  I notice plenty of wonderful things but you can't look at this world as it is and not find it coming up lacking.  

But I know I'm not the only one like this - this hyper-vigilance against imperfection is the hallmark of the stand up comic, the quality assurance engineer, and the concrete layer. And of course, the designer.  Designers know no matter how good something is, it can always be better.

Maybe you're a complainer, too?  You're in good company. Encouragement of (pointed, specific) complaint is the heart and soul of good design.  "Good enough" doesn't motivate change.  Generic dissatisfaction never shows a way forward.  But specific, snarky, berating complaint...now that's where the money is. 

It won't make you popular, either.  But it will make you better at your job.  Tech is filled with problem solvers.  If you can be a problem identifier, you can make real change.
