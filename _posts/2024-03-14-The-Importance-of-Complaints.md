I will never be the most popular person.  There are plenty of people who I rub the wrong way.  You see, I am by my nature a complainer.  I'm never quite satisfied. Like the Terminator, I am constantly scanning my environment and evaluating and judging.  I notice plenty of wonderful things but you can't look at this world as it is and not find it coming up lacking.  

I'm not the only one like this - this hyper-vigilance against imperfection is the hallmark of the stand up comic, the quality assurance engineer, and the concrete layer.  [^1] And of course, the designer.

Never fear, however.  Encouragement of (pointed, specific) complaint is, I will argue, the heart and soul of good design.  "Good enough" doesn't motivate change.  Generic dissatisfaction never shows a way forward.  But pointed, snarky, berating complaint...now that's where the money is. 

It won't make you popular, either.  If you put on this imperfection scanning view, you may find yourself invited to fewer meetings. 

But problem solvers come a dime a dozen - if you can be a problem identifier, you can make real change.


[^1]: "Wait" says the attentive reader.  "Isn't this perfectionism?""  It is not.  I am much less interested in my own shortcomings than those outside of me.
