This is the first part in a series I'm calling "Unifying Tone".  The introduction to the concept is covered [here](/2024/04/09/Unifying-Tone.html) and I'm hoping to flesh out each step a little more.

Every introduction to public speaking includes the admonititon to know your audience.  I've had it on my own slides for years.  In my experience, however, this is the kind of vague advice that leaves one unsure of how to take the first step.  My series on unifying tone came out of that, with the audience question fitting into the greater schema.

Start with your own intent. This has a couple of advantages but at the very least, you have access to your intent even if you don't have access to the mind of your audience (yet).

You need to answer the question: what am I even doing here?  What reason do I have to open mouth or take these people's time?  

I imagine a conversation with my kid when she was a preschooler.

Q: Why are you presenting today?

A: My collegeaue asked me to.

Q: But why did she ask you to?

A: People in the department were curious.

Q: Why were people curious?

A: We've talked about trying to do this thing for years but the technical challenges seemed insurmountable.

Q: But they aren't anymore?

A: No.

Q: What changed?

Q: Okay, one more time, _why_ are you presenting this?

Final Answer: I'm presenting to my colleagues to inform them about the innovations that have led to a breakthrough for a long term goal.

Wrapped in that answer is a lot of the things we're going to need building on top of this unifying tone layer cake.  The audience is my colleagues - I can assume a lot of background knowledge.  I know their interest because it was the interest that drove the talk.  The talk should be structured in a way that very briefly reminds them of the background and then goes straight into a demo.  They'll want to see pictures of everything.  I know the tone can be casual but it's a technical group so it also has to be thorough and complete.  The casualness means my slides can be just illustrative, they don't need to be particularly brand-unifying or anything. And I'll need to have a performance that invites and encourages interaction and questions.

It really just falls out of that first intent.

This type of talk is the one I give most often.  I call it "internal reporting" as it's the result of some independent investigation I have been asked to complete and then report the results to internal stakeholders.   My intent is to reach decision makers in my company (usually middle management in research, engineering, and product management) to provide them the information necessary to make some business decision.  The mark of success is that they feel confident enough in the information to make that decision.  

I'll be using this and 2 other "canonical" examples of talks to help illustrate the Unifying Tone concept:

- A conference paper presentation has a number of different intents that may support each other or undermine each other and each presenter will need to determine what of the goals should be emphasized most.  Some possible intents may include inspiring new research, finding collaborators, being a spokesperson for your team, lab or department, or building upon your cv.  If I've been successful here, I've gotten you to be deliberate and clear-eyed about your intent. 

- A product demo's intent is to showcase the core features, capabilities, and value of a product.  As a conference paper, a success is an engaged audience in the short term and the long term success is the adoption of the product.
