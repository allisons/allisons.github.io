                <p><p>Every introduction to public speaking includes the admonititon to know your audience.  I’ve had it on my own slides for years.  But in my experience, it’s nice work if you can get it. Most of the time the actual composition of your audience is fuzzy at best and often a complete mystery so what is a desolate public speaker to do?</p>

                <p><p>Thought experiment:  if you flip a coin 1000 times, what are the chances that you get 8 or more heads or tails in a row?  If you said 1 in 256 (2 to the 8th), you’re wrong.  If you didn’t say that, congratulations you’ve probably learned this material before and you can skip to the end.</p>

                <p><p>I came upon a colleague at work.  He was looking at a dataset that showed what he thought <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> was operator bias between two measurements.  He was looking at the data as delta between the two measurements in a bar chart sorted by (a completely arbitrary) sample ID.  The team was already half way through the tedious process of having new operators do new measurements to do a Gage R&amp;R.</p>

                <p><p>Desire paths are unplanned trails and an emergent property of many people making the same (predictable, understandable) choice to ignore the official path and taking a shorter one.  It’s frequently a diagonal across a corner, or a path through a field when the landscaper would have walkers circumnavigate.</p>
