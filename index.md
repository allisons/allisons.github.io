This framework anchors the project of this page.  Design is something something.  A data science designer (which is not a great name and I'm working on it) is responsible for the whole ecosystem that results in a data product.  Each step has important stakeholders and contributors who make the whole thing work but it's my contention that a holistic responsible party is often missing resulting in miscommunication, design failures, and a third thing I haven't thought of yet.  The posts on this page are sketches to help design the whole.
